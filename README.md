# KBubbleSort
BubbleSort using Kotlin

While giving an interview today, I mentioned that we wouldn't be doing anything like bubble sort algorithms.
That got me to thinking... it's been a long time since I have created a bubble sort algorithm, how hard could it be? Should be like riding a bike, yeah?

I came home from work and whipped this up... not perfect but yeah, pretty much like riding a bike!
